We consider two methods for learning node representations for classification using GNNs, which exploit the topological information from the nested sequence of graphs obtained through topological filtration, referred to as the graph hierarchy, in the context of training GNNs.  The first method modifies the training of GNN over graph hierarchies, while the second modifies the architecture to pass messages jointly between all hierarchical graph levels. We further introduce two novel methodologies for multi-scale joint aggregation to learn a more informative graph representation for GNNs. The first introduced a novel attention based aggregation that learns to weigh the importance and contribution of nodes within each graph level of the hierarchy during multi-scale joint aggregation, and the second learns a topological filtration of nodes through a learnable filter function that assigns values to nodes used for topological filtration at certain stages of training.%%
